			<h2>About LEAP</h2>
					<p>
						LEAP (Leaders of Environmental Awareness and Protection) is a nonprofit dedicated to combating and preventing habitat destruction on a local and global scale. With increasing urban development and wildfires in the bay area, habitats are being torn down, forcing wildlife to wander into residential areas, posing a threat to both humans and animals. With help from volunteers, we’ve contributed to reforestation efforts in the Bay Area, and fundraised for the victims of the California Wildfires. In the future, we hope to educate even more residents on what they can do to solve larger environmental issues like climate change and deforestation, for a more sustainable tomorrow.

					<p>
						Dhyan is a senior at Irvington High School who loves biology and computer science and has strong interests in subjects like climate change and deforestation. He was inspired by one of his teachers to play a bigger role in helping the community understand the effects of the rapidly deteriortaing ecosystems and how it will change the direction of our future. He has volunteered at places such as Tule Ponds and Coyote Hills to work with park rangers and ecology experts in order to get a better understanding on what can be done to protect the environment. Using the information that he has gathered from these organizations and professionals, Dhyan's goal is to use LEAP as a way to educate and encourage the community to be mindful of issues such as habitat destruction and climate change and make a difference in his community.

						Prithvi is a senior at Irvington High School, passionate about prevalent environmental issues such as deforestation, habitat destruction, climate change, and Colony Collapse Disorder. He volunteers at Sulfur Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, to care for animals that have been negatively impacted by the habitat destruction in his community. His interests have led him to intern with Dr. Moran, a professor at UC Merced, on studies concerning the effects of climate change on forests in Northern California. In addition, he interned with geologist Dr. Blueford at Tule Ponds Reserve, to gain experience with issues like water contamination in residential areas. With experience in sustainability development in big cities from working with Lyndon Valicenti, the Environmental Strategist for the City of Chicago, he aims to educate his community in what it takes to live sustainability.
